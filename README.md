# arc_lang

A compiler for a custom programming language.

## Note

Right now, if you're trying to compile the project, unless you're on an ARM64 processor it will not compile with the debug config or make config.
This is because it's setup to compile on an M1 Mac with clang.
Other support will be added eventually! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Steps (crossed off when implemented):

-   Tokenizer (current)
-   Parser
-   Compiler
